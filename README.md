# Group-Project-Matrix-Theory-Fractals

The given task for group project were as follows:

1. Write an introduction to fractals

2. Select either one of the following fractals (refer to table below):
 Sierpinski Gasket
 Sierpinski Carpet
 Sierpinski Pentagon
 Heighway Dragon
 McWorter Pentigree
 Koch Curve
 Koch Snowflake
 Levy Dragon
 Pentadentrite
*(In this project we choose Sierpinski Carpet for basic knowledge about fractal)

For the selected fractal, provide:
 a geometric description of how the fractal is constructed; show the calculation (algorithm)
 the IFS transformations,
 the code for generating the fractal via a Lindenmayer system (L-system),
 the similarity dimension of the fractal,
 special properties and interesting facts about the fractals, and
 references.

3. Produce your own fractals. Give a name, and provide information as above. Demonstrate its construction using animation and maplet interface if possible.
*(In this project we do a fractal that seems like fish shape and by using graphical user interface in Matlab)
